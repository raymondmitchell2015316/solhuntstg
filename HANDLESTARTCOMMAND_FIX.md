# HandleStartCommand Method Fix

## Issue Fixed
**Error:** `TypeError: messageHandlers.handleStartCommand is not a function`

## Root Cause
The MessageHandlers class was missing the `handleStartCommand` method that the render production bot was trying to call on line 72.

## Solution
Added the missing `handleStartCommand` method to the MessageHandlers class:

```javascript
/**
 * Handle start command
 * @param {Object} ctx - Telegram context
 */
async handleStartCommand(ctx) {
    const welcomeMessage = `üåü *Welcome to Airdrop Hunter!*

Discover hidden crypto opportunities by analyzing your wallet across multiple blockchain networks.

üîç Get started by analyzing your wallet address!`;

    const keyboard = {
        inline_keyboard: [
            [{ text: 'üîç Analyze Wallet', callback_data: 'analyze_wallet' }],
            [{ text: '‚ùì Help & Support', callback_data: 'help_support' }]
        ]
    };

    await ctx.replyWithMarkdown(welcomeMessage, { reply_markup: keyboard });
}
```

## Files Updated
- `handlers/messageHandlers.js` - Added handleStartCommand method

## Deployment Status
The method is now available and the render production bot should work without the "handleStartCommand is not a function" error.

## Testing
- Development bot running without errors
- Start command functionality implemented
- Ready for production deployment
