# Render Port Configuration Update

## Changes Made

The production bot file has been updated to use only Render's dynamically assigned PORT environment variable without fallback defaults.

### Key Updates

1. **Strict PORT Usage**
   ```javascript
   const serverPort = process.env.PORT;
   ```
   - Removed fallback port (was `|| 10000`)
   - Now relies entirely on Render's PORT assignment

2. **PORT Validation**
   ```javascript
   if (!serverPort) {
       console.error('‚ùå PORT environment variable not set by Render');
       process.exit(1);
   }
   ```
   - Validates PORT exists before attempting to bind
   - Fails fast if Render doesn't provide PORT

3. **Enhanced Logging**
   ```javascript
   console.log(`üåê HTTP server bound to Render port ${serverPort}`);
   ```
   - Confirms which port Render assigned
   - Helps with deployment debugging

## Render Environment

Render automatically provides the PORT environment variable when deploying web services. The updated bot will:

- Use whatever port Render assigns (typically 10000 or similar)
- Fail immediately if PORT is not provided
- Bind to 0.0.0.0 for proper external access
- Provide health endpoints at / and /health

## Deployment Steps

1. Upload updated `render_production_bot.js`
2. Deploy on Render
3. Render will automatically set PORT
4. Bot will bind to assigned port
5. No more port detection failures

This ensures complete compatibility with Render's port assignment system.
